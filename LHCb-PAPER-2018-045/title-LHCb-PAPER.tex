% Abstract -----------------------------------------------
\begin{abstract}
  \noindent
  The first untagged decay-time-integrated amplitude analysis of
  $\Bs \to \KS\Kpm\pimp$ decays is performed using a data sample
  corresponding to $3.0\invfb$ of $pp$ collision data recorded by the LHCb
  experiment during 2011 and 2012.
  The data are described by an amplitude model that contains contributions
  from the intermediate resonances $\Kstar(892)^{0,+}$, $K^*_2(1430)^{0,+}$ and
  $K^*_0(1430)^{0,+}$.
  Measurements of the decay modes $\Bs\to K^{*\pm}(892)\Kmp$ and
  $\Bs\to \KorKbar^{*0}(892)\KorKbar^{0}$ are in good agreement with, and
  more precise than, previous results. 
  The decays $\Bs\to \KstarIIpm\Kmp$ and
  $\Bs \to \KorKbar\!^{*}_{0}(1430)^0\KorKbar^{0}$ are observed for the
  first time with significance over 10 standard deviations.
%  a statistical significance of $17.3$ and $15.2\,\sigma$, respectively.  
  Systematic uncertainties associated to the contributions containing a tensor resonance preclude any statement on their significance.

%% Author List ----------------------------
%%  You need to get a new author list!
%\input{LHCb_authorlist.tex}
%
%The author list for journal publications is provided by the Membership Committee shortly after 'approval to go to paper' has been given.
%%It will be made available on the page
%%\verb!http://www.physik.uzh.ch/~strauman/forMemCo/LHCb-PAPER-XXXX-XXX/! .
%It will be sent to you by email shortly after a paper number has beens assigned.
%The author list should be included already at first circulation, 
%to allow new members of the collaboration to verify whether they have been included correctly.
%Occasionally a misspelled name is corrected or associated institutions become full members.
%In that case, a new author list will be sent to you.
%In case line numbering doesn't work well after including the authorlist, try moving the \verb!\bigskip! after the last author to a separate line.

%
%The authorship for Conference Reports should be ``The LHCb
%  collaboration'', with a footnote giving the name(s) of the contact
%  author(s), but without the full list of collaboration names.
