\section{Determination of signal and background yields}
\label{sec:dataset}

The signal and background yields are determined by means of a simultaneous
unbinned extended maximum likelihood fit to the 24 \B-candidate invariant
mass distributions that result from considering separately the four final
states, three data-taking periods and two \KS reconstruction categories.
Three components contribute to each invariant mass distribution:
signal decays, backgrounds resulting from cross-feeds, and random
combinations of unrelated tracks.
The contribution from a fourth category of background, partially
reconstructed decays, is reduced to a negligible level by performing the
fit in the invariant mass window $5200 < m(\Kshhp) < 5800\mevcc$.
The modelling of each of the three fit components follows that used in
Ref.~\cite{LHCb-PAPER-2017-010}.
A brief summary of the models used is given here.

Signal decays with correctly identified final-state particles are
modelled with the sum of two Crystal Ball (CB)
functions~\cite{Skwarnicki:1986xj} that share common values for the mean
and width of the Gaussian part of the function but have independent power
law tails on opposite sides of the Gaussian peak.
Cross-feed contributions from misidentified $\BdstoKshhp$ decays are also modelled with the sum of two CB functions.
Only contributions with a single misidentified track are included since contributions from other potential misidentified decays are found to be negligibly small.
The yield of each misidentified decay is constrained, with respect to the
yield of the corresponding correctly identified decay, using the ratio of
the selection efficiencies and the corresponding uncertainty.
The combinatorial background is modelled by a linear function.

The fit results for the \KsKpPim and \KsKmPip final states,
combining all data-taking periods and \KS reconstruction categories,
are shown in \fig{mass-fit}.
\tab{mass-fit} details the fitted yields of all categories, both in the
invariant mass region used for the mass fit and in the reduced region to be
used in the amplitude analysis, defined as $\mu\pm2.5\sigma$ where $\mu$
($\sigma$) is the fitted peak position (width) of the \Bs signal component in
that category.
The yields are given for each of the two final states broken down by
data-taking periods and \KS reconstruction categories.

\caption{\small
  Yields obtained from the simultaneous fit to the invariant mass
  distribution of $\Bs\to\KS\Kpm\pimp$ candidates in data for each fit category: signal, combinatorial background and cross-feed from from misidentified $\BdstoKshhp$ decays.
  The uncertainties given on the yields in the full range are statistical only.
  Yields in the signal region $\pm2.5\sigma$ around the \Bs\ peak are also given; the determination of uncertainties on these values is described in Sec.~\ref{sec:systematics}.
